Usage: 
    wizardby <command> <version-or-step> [/mdl:<mdl-file>] 
        [/connection:<connection-string>] [/platform:<platform-alias>] 
        [/environment:<environment-name>]
				
    /mdl or /m          - Specifies the name of a MDL file	 
    /connection or /c   - Specifies the connection string
    /platform or /p     - Specifies the platform alias
    /environment or /e  - Specifies the environment name or prefix 
                          within a "database.wdi" file.
	
    If "/m" is not specified, Wizardby searches for the first MDL
    file in the current directory.
    
    If "/c" is not specified, connection string is built up using
    "database.wdi".
    
    If "/p" is not specified, platform alias is taken from
    "database.wdi".
    
    If "/e" is not specified, environment defaults to "development".
	
Commands:
    wizardby info [/c:<connection-string>]
        
        Displays information about current database schema version and all 
        registered migrations.
        
    wizardby upgrade [/m:<mdl-file>] [/c:<connection-string>]
        [/p:<platform-alias>] [/e:<environment-name>]
        
        Upgrades the database schema from the current version to
        the most recent one.
        
    wizardby downgrade [/m:<mdl-file>] [/c:<connection-string>]
        [/p:<platform-alias>] [/e:<environment-name>]
        
        Downgrades the database schema from the current version to
        version 0, effectively reverting all changes.
      
    wizardby migrate <version> [/m:<mdl-file>] [/c:<connection-string>]
        [/p:<platform-alias>] [/e:<environment-name>]
        
        Migrates the database schema to the given "<version>".
        
    wizardby rollback [<step>] [/m:<mdl-file>] [/c:<connection-string>]
        [/p:<platform-alias>] [/e:<environment-name>]
        
        Rolls back at most "<step>" previous versions.
        
        If "<step>" is not specified, only the last version is 
        rolled back.
        
    wizardby redo [<step>] [/m:<mdl-file>] [/c:<connection-string>]
        [/p:<platform-alias>] [/e:<environment-name>]
        
        Rolls back "<step>" previous versions and then reapplies
        "<step>" following versions.
        
        If "<step>" is not specified, only the last version is redone.
        
Abbreviations:
    All commands and command-line keys can be abbreviated to the shortest
    unambiguous prefix. For example, "/connection" can be shortened 
    to just "/c"; "upgrade" can be abbreviated to "u". However,
    "rollback" cannot be shortened to "r" since this can be
    either "rollback" or "redo". Thus, "rollback" can be abbreviated
    to "ro" and "redo" - to "re".
    
    Environment name can also be abbreviated to the shortest
    unambiguous prefix. For example "/e:d" and "/e:development"
    refer to the same "development" environment provided there are
    no environments specified in the "database.wdi" with names
    starting with "d".
